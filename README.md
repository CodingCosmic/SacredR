# SacredR
designed to calculate wire dimensions of sculptures using the The "sratio" script, short for "SacredR", is a tool designed to calculate the dimensions of a wire sculpture based on user input. It takes into account the desired length of wire and the material used to create the sculpture. By providing these inputs, the script calculates the wire length, base length, height, and three angles (X, Y, and Z) required to construct the wire sculpture.

sratio (SacredR)
The "sratio" script is a handy tool for calculating the dimensions of a wire sculpture. It takes user inputs for wire length and material and outputs the necessary dimensions for constructing the sculpture. This readme provides instructions on how to use the script and explains the input and output parameters.

Getting Started
To use the "sratio" script, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository or download the "sratio" script file.
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the "sratio" script is located.
Usage
The "sratio" script requires two inputs from the user: the desired length of the wire in feet and the material used for the wire sculpture.

To run the script, execute the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
python sratio.py
Once the script is running, it will prompt you to enter the desired length of wire and the material. Enter the values as requested.

Example:

java
Copy code
Enter the desired length of wire (in feet): 3
Enter the material (copper, steel, aluminum, quartz): copper
The script will then calculate the wire length, base length, height, and three angles (X, Y, and Z) required to construct the wire sculpture based on the provided inputs.

Example output:

yaml
Copy code
Wire length: 36.0 inches
Base length: 28.62794153845858 inches
Height: 7.3720584615414175 inches
Angle X: 14.440647415744573 degrees
Angle Y: 75.55935258425542 degrees
Angle Z: 90 degrees
